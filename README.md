# 365-Algorithms

In 2018, I've started a project for impleting a daily CS algorithm that I'd found interesting. 
This repository includes some of those algorithms plus much more I'm adding.
They are implemented using Python 2 and I'm currently migrating them to Python 3.


## Installation

* Install git in your computer if you hadn't
https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git

* Install Python 3 
https://www.python.org/downloads/

## Repository organization

root:  \*.py files containing funtions of each algorithm
\tests: \*.py files that corresponds to test cases for each algorithm. The naming convention is <algorithm>_tests.py being <algorithm>.py the related implementation.

## Execution

In the directory just write,

```
python -m tests.<testname>
```

In example, 
```
python -m tests.binary_search_tests
```
